V.1 of Tic Tac Toe.

I have included 2 JS files - one which I'm happy with (aside from styles) where the computer makes a random play. I'm sure it could be streamlined but it functions.

The AI has been TRICKY. I've been working on this for a few days now. For about a day i was stuck with it making all possible moves, and now I've got it to a point where it is making a logical but not optimal move, and I can't work out the logic. I am going to move on and come back to it.
