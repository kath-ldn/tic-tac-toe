# V3.0 Tic Tac Toe with Unbeatable AI

## About

This is V3.0 of a Tic Tac Toe game that I made for [The Odin Project: Javascript Module, Project: Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe). The purpose of this was to practice organizing Javascript, factory functions and module patterns. The main objective was to have as little global code as possible. There was an additional option to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm (which I added in versions 2 and 3).

### Project History

* V1.0: Basic Tic Tac Toe
* V2.0: Above, with unbeatable AI using [Free Code Camp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
* V3.0:
    * Refactored code
    * Re-wrote unbeatable AI
    * Refined UI/UX
    * Added basic mobile responsiveness (not widely tested)
    * Added 'medium' setting

The V3.0 unbeatable AI is still based on the FCC tutorial, but I re-wrote it to suit the rest of my gameplay, and to further research and practice recursion. It's probably not as slick as the FCC one, but I understand it and have worked through it line-by-line - which feels more important!
