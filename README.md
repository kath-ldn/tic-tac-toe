V.2 I have completed the minimax function using the Free Code Camp tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org .
You can now choose between playing an easy AI or hard AI.

For the next version I will:
-Improve visuals
-Edit the modal form validation
-Create 'medium' AI
-Test & fix bugs - e.g. if close modal without submitting info, can still play
    -stop user being able to click before computer has
-make the turnclick function less hellish to read
-simplify easy function


V.1 of Tic Tac Toe.

I have included 2 JS files - one which I'm happy with (aside from styles) where the computer makes a random play. I'm sure it could be streamlined but it functions.

The AI has been TRICKY. I've been working on this for a few days now. For about a day i was stuck with it making all possible moves, and now I've got it to a point where it is making a logical but not optimal move, and I can't work out the logic. I am going to move on and come back to it.

to fix
-invoking red fumction
-enter own name
-reset + play again
-function endgame
-ctrl f tie
